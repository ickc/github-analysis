# Tutorial: the command line, start to finish

This walkthrough takes you from nothing to a published HTML dashboard using only
the `github-analysis` CLI. It mirrors the three pipeline stages: **fetch →
report → dashboard** (with `recreate` running all three at once).

## 1. Install and authenticate

```bash
uv tool install github-analysis
github-analysis --help
```

The CLI needs a GitHub token that can read Actions metadata for the target
account. Provide one of:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...        # or GH_TOKEN
# or: gh auth login            # token is read from ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml
```

## 2. Create a project and config

```bash
mkdir github-actions-report && cd github-actions-report
```

Create `analysis.toml` (works for an organization *or* a user account — set
`org` to either):

```toml
[analysis]
org = "example-org"
period = "last-year"
cache_dir = "cache"
reports_dir = "reports"
data_dir = "reports"
output_html = "docs/index.html"
summary_json = "docs/summary.json"

[dashboard]
title = "GitHub Actions Usage Analysis"
period_label = "last year"
# plan_minutes = 3000          # uncomment if you have a monthly minutes cap

[os_multipliers]
linux = 1
windows = 2
macos = 10
```

`period` accepts `last-year`, `last-6-months`, `last-3-months`, `last-month`, or
an explicit `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD` range.

## 3. Fetch raw data (stage 1)

```bash
github-analysis fetch --org example-org --period last-year --cache-dir cache
```

This caches verbatim API responses under `cache/example-org/<repo>/`, plus each
repository's visibility in `repo.json`. Re-running is cheap — cached runs and
jobs are reused unless you pass `--force`.

Add `--billing` to also cache GitHub's billing usage report under
`cache/_billing/example-org/`. The API appears to need an organisation owner (or the
`user` token scope for a user account); without that access `fetch` prints a
warning, skips it, and the dashboard falls back to estimated minutes.

Billing managers can download the usage report CSV from the organisation's
billing usage page instead (the summarized report covers up to a year) and
import it into the same cache:

```bash
github-analysis import-billing usage-report.csv --org example-org --cache-dir cache
```

## 4. Export metric CSVs (stage 2/3)

```bash
github-analysis report --org example-org --cache-dir cache --output-dir reports
```

Produces GitHub-compatible CSVs::

```text
reports/actions-usage-metrics/{workflows,jobs,repositories,runtime-os,runner-type}.csv
reports/actions-performance-metrics/{workflows,jobs,repositories,runtime-os,runner-type}.csv
```

Peek at a table without writing files:

```bash
github-analysis show usage repositories --org example-org --cache-dir cache --top 10
```

## 5. Build the dashboard (stage 3)

```bash
github-analysis dashboard --config analysis.toml
```

Writes the static dashboard to `docs/index.html` and machine-readable metadata
to `docs/summary.json`. When repository visibility is cached, the minute charts
have an **All repositories / Private repositories only** toggle, since only
private repositories use the plan's included minutes.

## 6. Or do it all at once

```bash
github-analysis recreate --config analysis.toml
```

`recreate` runs fetch → report → dashboard from a single config. Useful flags:

- `--skip-fetch` — reuse the cache and only regenerate outputs.
- `--skip-dashboard` — produce CSVs only.
- `--force` — re-fetch even when cached.
- `--billing/--no-billing` — fetch the billing usage report (default: the
  config's `billing` setting).

## 7. (Optional) verify against a GitHub export

If you have a reference snapshot exported from GitHub's UI, diff it against your
generated CSVs:

```bash
github-analysis compare reference-data reports
```

The comparison distinguishes genuine structural mismatches from expected
"snapshot drift" (newer runs, or repos no longer visible to your token).
