"""Stage 2 — the canonical intermediate representation.

:class:`ActionsDataset` is the single source of truth for the analysis. It holds
the org's jobs and runs as typed, immutable records (see
:mod:`github_analysis.domain`) and exposes them as *tidy* pandas DataFrames —
one row per job, one row per run — via cached properties.

**Why a tidy per-job table instead of GitHub-style aggregate CSVs?**
The original pipeline used GitHub's UI-export CSVs (already grouped by
workflow/repo/OS) as its intermediate representation. Those aggregates drop the
per-job timestamps, so any time-based view (monthly trends, "last green day")
could not be derived from them — the old dashboard had to secretly re-read the
raw cache to draw its monthly charts. A tidy per-job table keeps every measure
and dimension at full resolution, so *every* downstream view — the GitHub-style
aggregate tables **and** the time series — is a pure projection of this one
object. The aggregate CSVs become an export (see
:mod:`github_analysis.csv_export`), not the source of truth.
